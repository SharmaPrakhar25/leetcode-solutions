# LeetCode Solutions by Prakhar Sharma

Welcome to my curated collection of LeetCode solutions! As a senior backend engineer with 6+ years of experience in distributed systems, real-time APIs, and algorithmic problem-solving, I use this repository to demonstrate my approach to tackling a wide range of coding challenges.

## About This Repository
- **Purpose:** Showcase my problem-solving skills, coding style, and mastery of data structures and algorithms.
- **Approach:** Each solution is written for clarity, efficiency, and readability. Where relevant, I include comments explaining the logic and trade-offs.
- **Technologies:** Primarily Python, with select problems in other languages to demonstrate versatility.

## Solution Organization
- Problems are organized by their LeetCode number and title (e.g., `0001-two-sum/`).
- Topic-based folders (e.g., `Array`, `LinkedList`, `Heap`) group related problems for easy navigation.
- Some folders include solutions to similar problems from other platforms (e.g., GFG).

## Problem Index (Sample)
| #   | Title                                      | Topic         | Difficulty |
|-----|--------------------------------------------|--------------|------------|
| 1   | [Two Sum](0001-two-sum/)                   | Array        | Easy       |
| 21  | [Merge Two Sorted Lists](0021-merge-two-sorted-lists/) | LinkedList | Easy       |
| 33  | [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](0033-search-in-rotated-sorted-array/) | Array | Medium |
| 53  | [Maximum Subarray](0053-maximum-subarray/) | Array        | Easy       |
| 102 | [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](0102-binary-tree-level-order-traversal/) | Tree | Medium |
| ... | ...                                        | ...          | ...        |

> **Note:** For a full list, browse the folders above or use GitHub search.

## How to Use
- Each problem folder contains the solution file(s) and, where helpful, a README or comments explaining the approach.
- Solutions are designed to be self-contained and easy to understand.

## Why This Matters
- Demonstrates my ability to solve real-world algorithmic problems efficiently.
- Showcases code quality, documentation, and structured thinkingâ€”key skills for backend and systems engineering roles.
