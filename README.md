## 🌱 The Evolution: From Novice to Algorithm Architect

### 🎯 **Phase 1: Foundation Building** *(Early 2022)*
My journey began with the classics. Two Sum wasn't just my first LeetCode problem—it was my introduction to the elegance of hash map optimization. Those early days were about understanding that sometimes, the difference between O(n²) and O(n) isn't just about efficiency; it's about thinking differently.

**Key Breakthrough:** Realizing that most brute force solutions have elegant optimizations hiding in plain sight.

### 🏗️ **Phase 2: Data Structure Mastery** *(Mid 2022 - 2023)*
This was my builder phase. Linked lists, binary trees, stacks—I didn't just solve problems, I internalized the patterns. Each data structure became a tool in my mental toolkit, ready to be wielded when the problem demanded it.

**Signature Achievement:** Implementing binary tree level-order traversal with a custom dictionary-based approach that showcased both BFS understanding and Python's elegant data structures.

### ⚗️ **Phase 3: Algorithm Alchemy** *(2023 - 2024)*
Here's where I learned to think like the problems wanted me to think. Modified binary search for rotated arrays, memoized recursion for dynamic programming, greedy algorithms with frequency analysis—each solution became a small masterpiece of logic.

**Defining Moment:** Cracking "Search in Rotated Sorted Array" taught me that sometimes you need to break the rules to follow them better.

### 🎨 **Phase 4: Optimization Artist** *(2024 - Present)*
Now I don't just solve problems—I craft solutions. My recent work on "Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word II" (#3016) represents years of accumulated wisdom: mathematical reasoning, optimization theory, and clean implementation all rolled into one.

## 🧠 My Problem-Solving Philosophy

### The PARSE Method
- **P**attern Recognition: Every problem is a variation of something I've seen
- **A**lgorithm Selection: Choose the right tool for the job
- **R**efactoring Mindset: First make it work, then make it elegant
- **S**calability Thinking: Always consider time and space complexity
- **E**legance Over Complexity: Simple solutions are often the best solutions

## 🎪 Signature Solutions That Define My Style

### 🏆 **The Hash Map Virtuoso**
```python
# Two Sum - Where it all began
def twoSum(self, nums, target):
    numMap = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in numMap:
            return [numMap[complement], i]
        numMap[num] = i
```
*This solution embodies my love for O(n) optimizations and clean, readable code.*

### 🌊 **The BFS Navigator** 
```python
# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
def levelOrder(self, root):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    queue = [(root, 0)]
    levels = {}
    
    while queue:
        node, level = queue.pop(0)
        if level not in levels:
            levels[level] = []
        levels[level].append(node.val)
        
        if node.left:
            queue.append((node.left, level + 1))
        if node.right:
            queue.append((node.right, level + 1))
    
    return [levels[i] for i in sorted(levels.keys())]
```
*Custom dictionary-based level tracking—sometimes the best solution is the one you build yourself.*

### 🔍 **The Binary Search Surgeon**
```python
# Search in Rotated Sorted Array - The breakthrough moment
def search(self, nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        
        # Determine which side is sorted
        if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:  # Left side is sorted
            if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        else:  # Right side is sorted
            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
    
    return -1
```
*When the array is rotated, you adapt your binary search. This solution taught me that algorithms are flexible tools, not rigid rules.*
